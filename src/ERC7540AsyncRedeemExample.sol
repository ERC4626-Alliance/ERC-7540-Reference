// THIS VAULT IS AN UNOPTIMIZED, POTENTIALLY UNSECURE REFERENCE EXAMPLE AND IN NO WAY MEANT TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION


/** 
@notice ERC7540 Implementing Delayed Async Withdrawals 

    This Vault has the following properties:
    - yield for the underlying asset is assumed to be transferred directly into the vault by some arbitrary mechanism
    - async redemptions are subject to a 3 day delay
    - new redemptions restart the 3 day delay even if the prior redemption is claimable. 
        This can be resolved by using a more sophisticated algorithm for storing multiple requests.
    - the redemption exchange rate is locked in immediately upon request.
    - users can only redeem the maximum amount. 
        To allow partial claims, the redeem and withdraw functions would need to allow for pro rata claims. 
        Conversions between claimable assets/shares should be checked for rounding safety.
